Please send comments, bugs and suggestions to: m.colbrook@damtp.cam.ac.uk

The code includes a main routine **mpEDMD** as well as the three examples from the paper. Other examples will be added in the future. If you have an example and want to add it, please get in touch! 

**Datasets** (needed for turbulent flow example) can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xj59e5in7dfsobi/AAAfkxqa1x9WFSTgrvqoqqRqa?dl=0

Some of the code also makes use of Chebfun, which can be found at https://www.chebfun.org/.
